Significant changes were made to the MarbleSolitaireModelImpl class since version 1.0
All functionality remains the same, only the code has been moved elsewhere.
All of the class's methods have been abstracted to the AbstractSolitaireModel class. Of these, only
the getGameState() method was modified. Again, no functionality of this method was changed, it was
simply abstracted in order to produce the correct String output for any Marble Solitaire game with
the same rules for valid moves.
